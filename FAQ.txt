FAQ

**MODIFYING THE GAME**

Q: How much of the game (mechanics/code) can you modify?
A: 100%. It's just a question of time and skill.

Q: Can you make a completely new map with never seen before Models/Assets?
A: Yes, but I need someone to make them (Models/Assets) for me.

Q: When will the test patch be released for steam download?
A: When it is thoroughly bugtested, to which it will be sent to 9Heads for their approval, then it will be launched officially.

Q: Can we expect a new monster?
A: Not at the moment. While I can make new monsters, current priority is to optimize the existing ones, especially Fallen and Phantom.




**COMMUNITY EFFORTS**

Q: Can I help?
A: There are 3 things you can do:

1. Help us bugtest our content - even playing solo in games can help us in the process of finding bugs!

2. Spread awareness to other players about the patch or inform them the game was officially updated - not many players check steam forums.

3. If you have 3D Modelling Skills, you could create new Assets/Models.
You'd have to look up how to export 3D Models you made in Maya (with this plugin:  https://github.com/OGRECave/maya-ogre3d-exporter) to Ogre3D 1.8 (our current engine).


Q: I found a bug, what do I do?
A: Thanks for your help - you can report bugs in the Damned discord (in the correct tab), or in the new bug report subforums for Damned here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/251170/discussions/2/

Q: I HAVE AN AMAZING NEW IDEA
A: Awesome, please create a new Thread in General Discussions, or in the Damned discord, so we can see it.

Q: Can I be part of the team?
A: Currently, only I possess the rights to make in game coding changes, however, there could be potential for you if you are interested in creating maps for the game.
If you would like to be part of the mapping process, join the Damned discord and post in the channel titled "#Custom-mapping" and moderators will screen you/your content.




**MISC**

Q: Since you've been in contact with the developers, surely you know if they are working on Damned 2?
A: We do not know anything about what projects 9Heads is working on, but we will keep the original Damned updated with new content.
